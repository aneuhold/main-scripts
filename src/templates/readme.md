## Templates

This folder is meant to house templates for various project types. They are stored with the following format:

```
template-name/
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ index.js
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ readme.md
```

Further details might be able to be stored in a JSON object at the root of the templates directory as well if needed at some point.

## Notes
