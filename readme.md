# Main Scripts

This repo contains the main scripts I use on any OS (besides mobile... for now?). This should be installed and initially invoked by the startup script in the [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/aneuhold/dotfiles).

If you would like to start a project with this as a basis, feel free to fork / copy and paste into another repo!

## üì¶ Installation

This is typically meant to be installed globally. So for compatibility reasons, the best way to use this is to run:

```
npm install -g @aneuhold/main-scripts
```

This can also be used as a dev dependency

## ‚úÖ Commands

Each command starts with `tb`. That stands for Tiny Box but that isn't really important üòõ.

- `tb help` Will emit all the commands and their options
- `tb open` Will open the current directory in either VS Code, or Rider depending on the project as it is configured in [`projects.ts`](src/config/projects.ts).
- `tb test` Just emits a test echo to see if the package is working.
- `tb update` Will force update this package.
- `tb fpull` Will run `git fetch -a` then `git pull` in the current working directory.
- `tb setup` Will setup the development environment according to the current working directory name. If settings have not been determined yet for the directory name, shell, or terminal, then it will inform you and won't do anything else.
- `tb startup` Will run the startup script for the current system with no arguments
- `tb scaffold [projectType] [projectName]` Will build the given project type with the given project name as a new folder in the current working directory named with the given `projectName`.
- `tb pkg [packageAction]` Performs actions related to package publishing. Supported actions are: `validateJsr`, `publishJsr`, `validateNpm`, `publishNpm`, `testStringReplacement`. This is typically used inside a package.json file as one of the scripts.

### Commands specifically for `package.json` scripts

- `tb pkg validateJsr` Will run a few steps, where if one fails, the next do not proceed, with exception of reverting the updates to `jsr.json`. That always runs if it was changed:
  1.  Check if there are any pending changes that haven't been committed
  1.  Update the current working directory's `jsr.json` `version` field to match the `version` field in the `package.json` in the same directory
  1.  Run `jsr publish --allow-dirty --dry-run` to ensure it passes the checks of JSR
  1.  Revert the change to the local `jsr.json` file
- `tb pkg publishJsr` Will do the same steps as above, but the `jsr` command will be `jsr publish --allow-dirty`. If running locally, this will prompt you to login with your local browser to JSR and permit the publish. In CI, it should handle this without any intervention if the JSR GitHub action is used.
- `tb pkg validateNpm` Will validate the current project for publishing to npm by running `npm publish --access public --dry-run` and checking for version conflicts on the npm registry.
- `tb pkg publishNpm` Will publish the current project to npm by running `npm publish --access public` after performing validation checks.
- `tb pkg testStringReplacement -o "original" -n "new"` Will test the string replacement functionality used by the package service to replace package names during publishing.

#### Package Command Options

All package commands support the following options:

- `-a, --alternative-names <names...>` Specify alternative package names to use for publishing/validation. This allows you to test or publish the same package under multiple names.
- `-o, --original-string <string>` For `testStringReplacement` action: the original string to replace.
- `-n, --new-string <string>` For `testStringReplacement` action: the new string to replace it with.

#### Examples

```bash
# Validate JSR publishing with alternative package names
tb pkg validateJsr -a @scope/alt-name @scope/another-name

# Publish to npm with multiple package names
tb pkg publishNpm -a @company/package-v1 @company/package-v2

# Test string replacement functionality
tb pkg testStringReplacement -o "@old/package-name" -n "@new/package-name"
```

> The JSR commands require `jsr` as a dev dependency

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

### Windows Permissions Error with NPM

Sometimes it seems that permissions get messed up. The only solution seems to go to the Program Files for `nodejs` and change the permissions for that folder to allow all local users to have full control. Otherwise installing anything with nodejs doesn't seem to work anymore.

### Error About Promises.Any when Running Commands

Node likely needs to be updated. Anything 14.x and earlier doesn't support ES2016 syntax pretty sure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### üèû Flow for Writing New Commands

1. Write the new command in the TypeScript files
1. Test the command by running `yarn refresh`. Keep running this whenever you want to test the command again.
1. When ready to deploy an update to the package
   1. Run `yarn version patch`
   1. Run `yarn lint`
   1. Run `git push` to push to the main branch. Otherwise, feel free to make a PR + run checks + merge it.
1. When done making changes to the package, use `yarn reset:global` to set the package to the npm registry version instead of having it linked locally.

### `package.json` Commands

- `yarn refresh` can be used for testing new commands. It will uninstall any previous global version of this package and then install the local version.
- `yarn reset:global` will uninstall the global package and reinstall it from the npm registry instead of locally.
- `yarn add <package-name>` Use yarn to add packages preferably.

### Build Process Description

This consists of the following steps:

- Delete the `./lib` folder
- Generate the files with TypeScript into the `./lib` folder, including `package.json` because it uses that in some parts of the code.
- Copy over the templates from the templates folder and overwrite because TypeScript does not copy over anything that isn't `.ts`.

### Publish Process Description

- Run `yarn build`
- Packs the files only including the the `./lib` folder and the [default things included](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/developers). This does mean that the `package.json` is going to be in the package twice. But that is okay because the `package.json` that is in the `lib` folder will only be used to reference values. It isn't used for commands or locations of any anything.
- Pushing to main will automatically publish it to NPM
