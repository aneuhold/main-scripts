# Main Scripts

This repo contains the main scripts I use on any OS (besides mobile... for now?). This should be installed and initally invoked by the startup script in the [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/aneuhold/dotfiles).

This is also deployed to [NPM here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aneuhold/main-scripts).
